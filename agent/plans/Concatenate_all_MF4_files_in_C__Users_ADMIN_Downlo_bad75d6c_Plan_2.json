    "reasoning": "[RECOVERY PLAN]\nCompleted 12 steps successfully.\nRecovery reasoning: 1) What the original plan ASSUMED vs what ACTUALLY exists: The original plan assumed an 'Add files' menu item inside the File menu / Batch view would be present. The actual captured UI (STATE_12) shows that 'Add files' does not exist. Instead, the File menu contains an 'Open' item (control present at [1338,78]) and the Batch view already exposes an explicit 'Concatenate' tab and a 'Concatenate' button. The failure happened because the automation tried to click a non-existent 'Add files' menu item.\n\n2) Intent of the failed action: The intent was to open a file-selection dialog that allows adding multiple MF4 files into the Batch list so they can be concatenated and saved to a single MF4 file in the same folder.\n\n3) Actual elements found to achieve the same intent: The File\u2192Open menu item is visible and is a supported path to open multiple files in Batch mode (KB 'open_files'). The Batch view's Concatenate tab and the Concatenate button are visible. These elements provide an alternate, valid route to add files and perform the concatenation.\n\n4) How KB guidance informed the new approach: The knowledge base explicitly lists File\u2192Open as the supported method to open one or more MDF/MF4 files, and confirms this is viable in Batch processing mode. Using File\u2192Open replaces the missing 'Add files' menu item and aligns with the app's documented behavior.\n\n5) Which pending steps were reused/adapted: Many of the original pending steps remain valid: waiting for the Open dialog, capturing the dialog to locate filename/address and Open buttons, entering the target folder path with a wildcard (*.mf4), confirming the selection, ensuring the Concatenate tab is selected, setting the output filename, and pressing the Concatenate action. These were reused but adapted to use the actual 'Open' menu item (which exists) as the trigger instead of the missing 'Add files'. Additional State-Tool calls were inserted at key points to dynamically discover dialog controls and confirm UI changes before clicking.\n\n6) Why this approach will succeed: This plan uses only UI elements confirmed present in the captured state (the visible 'Open' menu item and the 'Concatenate' tab/button). It replaces the unsupported assumption ('Add files') with the supported File\u2192Open path from the KB. The plan includes repeated State-Tool captures before interacting with dialog/edit controls so the automation always acts on actual, discovered controls rather than guessed names. Prioritizing the discovered control references (e.g., multiple possible edit/button names in the STATE references) makes the plan robust to minor localization or naming differences. Finally, the plan ends with a final state capture (STATE_31) to verify success and detect any errors reported by the application.\nTotal steps in merged plan: 31",
