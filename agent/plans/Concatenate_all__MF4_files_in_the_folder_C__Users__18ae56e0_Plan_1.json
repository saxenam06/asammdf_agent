    "reasoning": "[RECOVERY PLAN]\nCompleted 6 steps successfully.\nRecovery reasoning: DETAILED EXPLANATION REQUIRED:\n1. ASSUMPTION vs REALITY: The original plan assumed an 'Add files' button existed in the Batch processing UI. The captured state shows no 'Add files' element, but does show a File menu and an 'Open' menu item plus active Concatenate tab/button. Therefore the assumption about the 'Add files' control was incorrect; however, the File\u2192Open path is available.\n\n2. INTENT: The failed action intended to open a file-selection dialog to load all .MF4 files into Batch processing so they could be concatenated into a single output MF4 file saved in the same folder.\n\n3. ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION: Use File \u2192 Open (documented in the KB) to load multiple files while in Batch processing mode. Specifically: open File menu, choose Open, navigate to the target folder using the file dialog's 'File name' edit, select one file then Ctrl+A to multi-select all .MF4 files, confirm to load them into Batch processing. Then select the Concatenate operation/tab and trigger the Concatenate action which opens a save dialog where the output path/name can be specified.\n\n4. KB GUIDANCE: The knowledge base explicitly lists File \u2192 Open as a method to load multiple MDF/MF4 files and confirms Batch processing supports multiple-file selection. It also documents switching to Batch processing mode (already done). The recovery follows that KB workflow but uses the actual File menu elements visible in the current state.\n\n5. PENDING PLAN ADAPTATION: Kept steps that are valid: navigating the file dialog by typing the folder path, using Ctrl+A to select all files, confirming selection, choosing the Concatenate operation, and entering the output filename. Modified steps: replaced the missing 'Add files' button click with File \u2192 Open menu interactions. Added explicit State-Tool calls after each menu/dialog change to ensure element references are fresh and valid. Discarded any reliance on a non-existent 'Add files' control.\n\n6. SUCCESS RATIONALE: This plan uses only elements present in the captured UI (File menu, Open, Concatenate tab/button, file dialog 'File name' edit) and follows KB-approved workflows. By typing the folder path into the file dialog and using Ctrl+A, all .MF4 files will be reliably selected and loaded into Batch processing. Invoking the Concatenate action opens the save dialog so we can specify the exact output filename (Tesla_Model_3_3F78A21D.mf4) in the same folder, then start the concatenation. Frequent State-Tool calls ensure each step acts on currently visible elements, avoiding the previous failure caused by assuming a missing control.\nTotal steps in merged plan: 26",
